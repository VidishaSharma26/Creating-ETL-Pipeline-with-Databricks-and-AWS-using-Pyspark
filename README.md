## ETL PIPELINE
1. ETL stands for Extract, transform and load.
2. The basic principle of ETL is that we have some source, we have some destination and we have our driver program. 
3. What driver program will do, it will extract the data from the source considering the E, then it will do some sort of transformations(it is optional), next is the load- so this driver program will load all the transformed data or the simple data to the target source
4. So ETL pipeline is the name of this complete pipeline in which we read the data from the source, performing any transformation and then loading that data to some output destination
